# Microsoft Server Repair Workcell Project
This is the repository for ROS robot code for a UW ECE student capstone project sponsored by Microsoft. The goal of the 5-month project is to use two 7-DOF KUKA iiwa robots to create a workcell that automates server repair in a datacenter setting using machine vision. 

Using iiwa_stack for iiwa integration: https://github.com/IFL-CAMP/iiwa_stack
